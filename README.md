# OpenCDE API standards

The openCDE initiative is a portfolio of API standards.

The foundation API can be found here: https://github.com/buildingSMART/foundation-API

On top of the Foundation API there are feature based additions:
- BIM Collaboration Format (BCF) API: https://github.com/buildingSMART/bcf-API
- Documents API: https://github.com/buildingSMART/documents-API
- Dictionary API (also implemented by the buildingSMART Data Dictionary): https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/buildingSMART/Dictionaries/v1
More API projects will follow later.
