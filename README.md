# OpenCDE-API

This repository is currently a work in progress and represents a collection of different ideas and results from ongoing discussions. Within, there is a collection of all standards originating from the buildingSMART OpenCDE group.

## Doucments API

The Documents API is the initial API developed within this group. It is an interactive way of syncing documents between client applications and CDEs. [Head to the sub category for further reading](DocumentsAPI/README.md).
